Android DOs: Data Binding adapters is a place to write custom view-related logic
=======

>TL;DR There are cases when we need to write code which customizes or enhanced behavior of views. Data Binding adapters is a perfect place for that (instead of writing such code in activities, etc.), because they define a place for custom view logic and help to have a clear boundary between application code and framework code. Adapters is framework code.
